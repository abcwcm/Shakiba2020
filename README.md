# Bioinformatics details for Shakiba et al., 2021

In Shakiba et al. (2021), we investigated factors that help define TCR interactions and their effect on the resulting T cell phenotype.
We found that tumor-specific T cells' dysfunction program is the composite of affinity-dependent and -independent modules, i.e. TST that encounter tumor antigens with high TCR signal strength rapidly lose effector functions, while TST with low-TCR signal strength for the tumor antigens retain another functional state.

Here, we provide the code details for the bulk RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data from tumor-infiltrating T cells with differing affinities for the tumor antigen.
Control cells were naive T cells and normal effector cells.

Raw data can be downloaded from GEO: SuperSeries GSE141818, including GSE141816 (ATAC-seq data) and GSE141817 (RNA-seq data).

Samples were prepared by Mojdeh Shakiba and the sequencing facility at MSKCC.
